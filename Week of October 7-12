If you were to take the derivative of this week's learning curve, it'd be of the nth order polynomial.
In addition to honing my skills in programming language, I also learned about my machine. I learned that I need more RAM
to be able to employ the tools that are going to make me successful in this course. 

I liked that my group did a decent job using ipython in lieu of doing a masterpiece with R. It's good to be able to adapt 
to the circumstances that our group was put in.
