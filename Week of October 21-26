This week I was ordered via my neurologist to take the week off to, for lack of a better word, reboot my brain
after having a series of seizures of which one that resulted in a concussion. Infact, today is the first day I have been
allowed to use a computer since I was told to take it easy on the eyes as to not allow myself to be overstimulated from
stimuli on a computer or the effort necessary to type e-mails and postings on social media. However, I did some light reading from
the book **Python for Data Analysis** and **Statistics** by Purves, Freedman, and Pires. Said combination helped me 
develop a stronger intuition for the field that I am interested in, experimental design. Although we are doing an
observational study in this course with the work of Dr. Stark, it is still important to know the fundamentals of random
processes. Chapter 2 of the Statistics book helped clarify what it means for a procedure to be random: that the laws
of chance govern the assignment of a treatment to control and subject groups in the experiment. It is more difficult
if not impossible in mundane life, i.e., outside of clincial trials, to assign treatments using the laws of chance
to one group who will receive the treatment and the other which will not. The importance of a randomized controlled
experiment relates to Dr. Stark's lectures when he delineated Freedman's Rabbit-Hat Thereom. Since we are not
conducting a randomized controlled experiment, the observational study that we perform must make the assumptions
of randomization (stochastic) transparent to its readers. I may not wholly understand the pith of stochastic
processes in the vein that the genius Dr. Stark does, but the FPP book provided a good path to helping me understand
the design of the our class observational study.
