This week I was ordered via my neurologist to take the week off to, for lack of a better word, reboot my brain
after having a series of seizures of which one that resulted in a concussion . However, I did some light reading from
the book **Python for Data Analysis** and **Statistics** by Purves, Freedman, and Pires. Said combination helped me 
develop a stronger intuition for the field that I am interested in, experimental design.
