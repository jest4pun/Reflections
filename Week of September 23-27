Reproducibility is important 



I thought that Professor Culich told students attempting to justify changing the due date of the weekly reflections
were only supported by rationalization, i.e., they conjured excuses as to why Sunday would be preferable to submit the 
reflections but never admitted that they were - at the end of the day - responsible for submission of the reflections. 
One of the excuses was downright pathetic: "Sunday night is when we all do our homework, and if they [reflections] are 
due on Saturday, we will forget to turn it in." First, not everyone procrastinates until the last minute, so it's not 
fair to use absolutes. Then comes the fact that there are a plethora of media that allows students to remind themselves of 
deadlines. No excuse can justify that
