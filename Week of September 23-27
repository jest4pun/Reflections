Reproducibility is important so that we can peer review the work of other scientists; therefore, we are able to verify the
the conclusions of an experiment before we accept the results at face value on the merit that it is published in a
national magezine or from an acclaimed university. It is important to verify protocol in research so that we make wise inferences
that rest on the support of peer-reviewed work. 



I appreciated the reality check that Professor Culich gave the class when he told students attempting to justify changing the due date of the weekly reflections
were only supported by rationalization, i.e., they conjured excuses as to why Sunday would be preferable to submit the 
reflections but never admitted that they were - at the end of the day - responsible for submission of the reflections. 
One of the excuses was downright pathetic: "Sunday night is when we all do our homework, and if they [reflections] are 
due on Saturday, we will forget to turn it in." First, not everyone procrastinates until the last minute, so it's not 
fair to use absolutes. Then comes the fact that there are a plethora of media that allows students to remind themselves of 
deadlines. No excuse can justify that
