This week's guest lectures were worthwhile. 

Eric Berlow provided a fantastic presentation of the probability models he employs in his research 
on the endangered Yosemite toad. Furthermore, it was impressive that he was able to present his
research even though there are legal parameters that surround his work that prevent him from doing so. Philip Stark
also peppered the presentation with some 

The A-Ha moment I had is that in order to allow for reproducibility in an experiment, even the random processes
be delineated in spite of their random nature. For example, say I ran an experiment where I used a random number generator
in R. To allow other experimenters to replicate the random number generating, I would make the seed transparent in 
publications of my reearch. In her award-winning article "Enabling Reproducible Research: Licensing for Scientific
Innovation, Victoria Stodden

The notion that results should be independently replicable, given an appropriate 
computer platform.28 Although the community of scientists who engage in reproducible research 
is small, a number of studies have shown that making papers and data available online leads to 
higher citation levels
